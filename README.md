Texas DPS Automatic Scheduler

# Why this project exist?
I waited at the DPS at 4am for a DL and I'm a fifth person there but at that day the DPS only gave out 3 tickets so I have to go home. It's so frustrating so I created this project to gain easier access to DPS and get your DL.

# Is this illigal?
Honesty, I don't know. Just dont abuse it :)
